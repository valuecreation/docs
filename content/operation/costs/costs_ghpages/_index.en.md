Although GitHub Pages is free of charges for an Open Source Project, there are some usage limits. See more details about GitHub Pages [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages).

* Published GitHub Pages sites may be no larger than 1 GB.
* GitHub Pages sites have a soft bandwidth limit of 100GB per month.
* GitHub Pages sites have a soft limit of 10 builds per hour.

### Case Studies
- In case of WASAC, Rwanda
WASAC's Vectortiles data in the whole country is currently only approximately **33MB**. So I think our usage should not be a problem.
- In case of Narok Water, Kenya
Narok Water's Vectortiles data is currently only approximately **2MB**. So I think our usage should not be a problem.
