## Create your `vt` repository from `vt-boilerplate` template repository

- click `use this template` on [watergis/vt-boilerplate](https://github.com/watergis/vt-boilerplate).
- select your organization and name `vt` for new repository.

After creating your own `vt` repository, you will work on this repository from next step. All the modules are included and packaged under `vt-boilerplate`. However, if you want to use some modules seperately, you can just use it.
