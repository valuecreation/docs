## Design your Mapbox Style on Mapbox Studio
Next step is to design your own Mapbox Style on Mapbox Studio by using `mbtile` which was produced before.

For better designs of beautiful water maps, you might need to design your own icons for your layers. You may use the following icons for your reference.

- `Narok Water and Sewerage Services Co., Ltd, KENYA` : [narwassco/water-icons](https://github.com/narwassco/water-icons)
- `Water and Sanitation Corporation, Ltd, RWANDA` : [WASAC/water-icons](https://github.com/WASAC/water-icons)
- `Nakuru Water and Sanitation Services Co., Ltd, KENYA` : [nakuruwater/water-icons](https://github.com/nakuruwater/water-icons)

You may need to create an account of Mapbox Studio. Also, please keep your public accessToken as well. 

You can see official manual of Mapbox Studio [here](https://docs.mapbox.com/studio-manual/overview/).

You may need to repeat process of `genrating mbtiles` and `styling in Mapbox Studio` for finalying your stylefiles.
