If you don't have any GIS data yet, you must go to data collection first. You might need some GPS devices such as `Trimble` or `Garmin`. But you can also use following smartphone applications for data collection.

- [QField for QGIS](https://qfield.org): It works on Android.
- [Input](https://inputapp.io/en/): It works on both iOS and Android.

Both applications are free and open source, it is completely compatible to QGIS. However, I personally recomment to use QField which is more advanced and user friendly.

You can also have a look about nice case study of `QField` in rural water supply systems in Rwanda from [here](https://qfield.org/docs/case-studies/rwanda-rural-water.html).

If you need some assists about data collection, please let me know.
