title: Install PostgresSQL/PostGIS database

This vectortiles toolkit uses PostgreSQL/PostGIS database. So, please try to install it in your computer.

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org)
- [PostGIS](https://postgis.net)

If you will install new one, I think you can install PostgreSQL12 and PostGIS3. I recommend to use at least more than PostgreSQL11 and PostGIS2.5.
