The following tools are maybe useful for your implementation of vector tiles

## Style file editor
- [Mapbox Studio](https://studio.mapbox.com): You can upload mbtiles and edit your own style. it's the best style editor although it can't allow us to use third party sources.
- [Maputnik Editor](https://maputnik.github.io/editor): You can edit your own style for any thirdparty vector tiles sources.
- [Maptiler](https://www.maptiler.com): You can upload mbtiles and edit your own style simply. However, you can combine to use Maptile and Maputnik Editor, it will be more flexible.

## Generating Vector Tiles
- [mapbox/tippecanoe](https://github.com/mapbox/tippecanoe): You can generate mbtiles from GeoJSON files.
- [QGIS](https://qgis.org): QGIS supports vector tiles from 3.14. You can generate vector tiles from any format by GUI.
- [unvt(United Nation Vector Tiles Toolkit)](https://github.com/unvt): UNVT Toolkits might guide you how to implement vecor tiles.
